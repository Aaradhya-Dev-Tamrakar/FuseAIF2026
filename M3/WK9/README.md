# WK9 — NEU Steel Defect CNN Classifier + Hardening

Fusemachines AI Fellowship 2026 · Week 9 Neural Network Assignment

**Notebook:** `W9_NEU_Defect_CNN_Assignment.ipynb`
**Status:** Built, syntax-validated, all code paths smoke-tested on reduced-scale runs. **Not executed at full scale** — see note below.
**Due:** 9 Jul 2026, 20:45 NPT

## Contents

- **Part 0** (Qs 1–5): NN foundations on flattened NEU images — 2-layer `nn.Module`, ReLU vs Sigmoid, CE vs MSE justification, SGD/Momentum/Adam + GPU memory estimate, BatchNorm1d vs Dropout ablation.
- **Part A** (Qs 1–6): CNN defect classifier — `ImageFolder` pipeline, dataset-computed normalization, Conv→ReLU→MaxPool ×2 architecture, 15-epoch training loop, curve analysis, per-class F1 + misclassified crazing/patches inspection.
- **Part B** (Qs 7–11): Hardening — train-only augmentation, BatchNorm2d, Dropout(0.4), cumulative comparison plot, written reflection.
- **Part C** (Qs 12–15): Tuning — 2×2 grid search, results table, StepLR scheduler, Optuna Bayesian search (12 trials).

## Setup

```bash
pip install torch torchvision optuna scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pillow --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir
```

Unzip `archive.zip` (NEU-DET dataset) into `data/NEU-DET/` before running — expects `data/NEU-DET/{train,validation}/images/<class>/`.

## Execution note

**CPU-only full-scale run time: ~172 minutes** (Part 0: ~29min for 140 total epochs across Qs 2/4/5; Part A/B/C CNN training: ~143min for 246 total epochs, dominated by the 96-epoch-equivalent Optuna search in Q15). This notebook was delivered unexecuted by request — run it end-to-end on a GPU (e.g. Colab) for a fast pass, or run as-is on CPU if time allows. Every cell's logic has been independently smoke-tested at reduced epoch counts/data subsets to confirm correctness before delivery; the only expected differences at full scale are the actual accuracy numbers and total wall time, not runtime errors.

If speed is needed and no GPU is available, the fastest lever is cutting Q15's Optuna `N_TRIALS` (currently 12) and/or its per-trial `epochs` (currently 8) — that cell alone accounts for roughly 56% of total projected runtime.
