# fuseAiF_wk7_customer_segmentation

Market segmentation pipeline on UCI Online Retail II — RFM feature engineering, K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering with business narrative and validation metrics.

---

## Context

**Fusemachines AI Fellowship 2026 | Week 7 | Phase 2: Foundational Statistical Learning**

A mid-sized retail company has ~500,000 raw transactions and no customer labels. The task is to construct a customer feature matrix from scratch, discover natural segments using three clustering algorithms, validate the results statistically, and translate findings into a business story a marketing team can act on.

---

## Dataset

[UCI Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) — real-world transactional data from a UK-based online retailer, covering approximately 500,000 line items across two years. Sheet used: `Year 2010-2011`.

> The dataset is not included in this repository. Download the `.xlsx` file from the UCI link above and place it in the project root before running the notebook.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Raw transactions (500k rows)
        ↓
Data Cleaning
  - Drop null CustomerIDs
  - Remove cancellations (Invoice prefix 'C')
  - Drop Quantity ≤ 0 / Price ≤ 0
  - Parse InvoiceDate, create TotalPrice
        ↓
Feature Engineering → one row per customer
  - Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)
  - AvgBasketSize, AvgDaysBetweenPurchases
  - UniqueProducts, ReturnRate
  - Category spend ratios (Gift / Home / Seasonal / Stationery / Other)
        ↓
Preprocessing
  - Outlier detection: IQR vs Z-score compared
  - Scaling: StandardScaler / RobustScaler (justified per data distribution)
        ↓
Clustering
  - K-Means       → Elbow + Silhouette for k; k-means++ vs random init comparison
  - Hierarchical  → Ward, Complete, Average, Single dendrograms; Ward + Complete fitted
  - DBSCAN        → k-distance ε estimation; ≥3 (ε, min_samples) combos; noise analysis
        ↓
Validation
  - Silhouette Score · Davies-Bouldin Index · Calinski-Harabasz Index
  - Cross-method comparison table
  - Final model decision: metrics + business reasoning
        ↓
Business Narrative
  - One-paragraph profile per cluster (plain language + RFM mean values)
  - Specific marketing action per segment
  - 200–300 word executive summary for non-technical stakeholders

## Key Techniques

| Stage | Method | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Feature engineering | RFM + 4 behavioral + 5 category ratios | Category ratios via keyword bucketing on `Description` |
| Outlier handling | IQR and Z-score | Both computed; choice justified per feature skew |
| Scaling | StandardScaler / RobustScaler | Selection depends on residual outlier presence post-capping |
| K-Means | `k-means++` init, k = 2–10 | Elbow + Silhouette used together; init stability compared |
| Hierarchical | Ward · Complete · Average · Single | All 4 dendrograms; Ward + Complete fitted to scaffold columns |
| DBSCAN | ε from k-distance plot | ≥3 param combos; noise points analyzed as business segment |
| Validation | Silhouette · Davies-Bouldin · Calinski-Harabasz | DBSCAN: noise excluded before metric computation |
