# AARADHYA DEV TAMRAKAR — Master Profile v103

*Last updated: June 21, 2026 — v103: Portfolio SEO hardening session on `aaradhyadtmr.github.io` (current live state: plain GitHub Pages, single-file vanilla JS — Netlify + Decap CMS is a **planned future migration, not yet executed**; user is also considering GitHub Projects for a multi-page site as an alternative). `index.html` already had strong on-page SEO (title/meta description, OG + Twitter cards, canonical, JSON-LD Person schema, single H1, proper heading hierarchy). Added the two missing pieces: `robots.txt` (Allow: / + sitemap reference) and `sitemap.xml`, both pushed to repo root and confirmed live via direct URL fetch. Created and verified a Google Search Console property (URL prefix, HTML-file verification method — `google3e772e11a3eb8313.html` uploaded to repo root, ownership verified). Submitted `sitemap.xml` via Search Console Sitemaps report. Settings → Crawling showed "No robots.txt file" / "No data available yet" with Open Report buttons greyed out immediately post-verification — confirmed normal for a brand-new property (no crawl cycle yet), not a bug; live file fetch confirmed robots.txt correct. Flagged but unresolved: `og:image`/`twitter:image`/JSON-LD `image` point to `photo.png` at 400×500, which is undersized/wrong-aspect for OG previews (ideal 1200×630) — fix not yet applied. Also flagged: no `theme-color` meta tag; JSON-LD could add `knowsAbout`/richer `worksFor`. Deliverables: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` (both in repo).*

*Previous: v102: KEC Makerspace website (`KEC-innovation/makerspace-main`) work logged as the active Makerspace Ambassador web-dev deliverable. Established a Claude-as-orchestrator + GitHub Copilot Pro "Raptor mini" (preview model) execution workflow — Claude audits the live repo and writes scoped copy-paste prompts; Raptor mini executes them in VS Code Agent/Edit mode. Four rounds shipped same-day: (1) site-wide bug fixes — malformed `<img loading>` attribute bug (48 instances/17 files, root-caused to a regex bug in `scripts/optimize_site.py` + `fix_site_optimization.py`, now fixed plus a new `repair_img_tags.py`), unified opening hours across 3 stale sources, 3D Scanner badge/alt-text fix, SOP buttons wired to `docs/*.md` (stub content, not final), 2× Bambu Lab A1 printer card added, hero photo swapped to a real interior shot; (2) follow-up audit found SOP docs are still stubs, the new Bambu A1 card's SOP button mislinks to `get-started.html`, `.tag-required/.tag-free/.tag-soon` CSS is duplicated/inconsistent between `style.css` and an inline block in `offerings.html`, and a stale Apr-26 event is still sitting in "Upcoming"; (3) font audit root-caused site-wide faux-bold headings — Changa One / Gravitas One are loaded at weight 400 only (no real bold cut exists on Google Fonts) but `h1–h4` default to browser-bold and 7 elements force 700/800 on top, causing browser-synthesized distortion (Syne is fine, loaded at real 600/700/800; Rammetto One is loaded on all 17 pages but used nowhere — dead weight + an orphan CSS class; `--text-faint` also fails WCAG AA contrast in both themes); (4) navbar animation proposals (sliding underline, hamburger→X morph, mobile-nav slide transition, theme-toggle icon cross-fade, scroll-elevation shadow, logo hover lift) wrapped in a `prefers-reduced-motion` guard out of respect for a prior in-repo decision to strip animations, plus a found bug where the desktop active-nav-link color (`--accent`) doesn't match the mobile one (`--accent2`). Pending real SOP content and Thursday-workshop details before the event-system tasks can be finished.*

*Previous: v101: Dual-boot/partition/BitLocker setup documented (Ubuntu 26.04 LTS "Resolute Raccoon", Secure Boot ON, Fast Startup OFF; 1TB NVMe layout: C: 701.82GB / D: 150GB BitLocker / Ubuntu root 92.2GB / swap 7.8GB). Both Windows volumes BitLocker-encrypted via TPM+Secure Boot Device Encryption — manual `cryptsetup bitlkOpen` unlock flow documented (GUI paste unreliable). Recovery keys live on Microsoft Account + SD card backup, matched by Key ID (full key digits deliberately not stored in this doc). Time-sync dual-boot clock drift fixed via `timedatectl set-local-rtc 1`. Intel Arc iGPU confirmed working natively (Mesa, in-kernel) with VA-API hardware video decode verified (`intel-opencl-icd intel-media-va-driver` — note renamed package on 26.04, needs universe/multiverse repos). D: drive automount blocked by encryption; keyfile-based auto-unlock not yet implemented.*

*Previous: v100: Acer Swift Go 16 fan issue diagnosed and resolved. Root cause: GNOME Power Mode set to "Power Saver" was capping load below the EC's fan-trigger threshold — not a driver/firmware/EC fault. `acpi-fan`, `acer_wmi`, intel_pstate (active, HWP-reactive) all confirmed working correctly. Fix: set Power Mode to Balanced (not Power Saver) for daily use; leave cpufreq governor on `powersave` (intel_pstate active mode is reactive, not fixed-low-clock — `schedutil`/`ondemand` unavailable under intel_pstate active). Verified via `stress-ng`: fans ramped audibly at 102–112°C under `performance` governor + non-Power-Saver profile. No throttling/critical events found in dmesg. Full diagnostic trail added to System Setup §.*

*Previous: v99: 12-Factor App pre-commit checklist added as §16 (Fellowship Dev Standards). Mandatory verification before every final git commit on fellowship and Nexus projects.*

*Previous: v98: RF and Microwave Engineering Lab reports added. Lab 1 (ADS intro: DC/AC/parameter sweep) and Lab 2 (impedance matching — quarter-wave transformer 50→150Ω @100MHz; lumped L-section match 15+j10Ω @2.5GHz via Smith Chart Matching Utility, refined to -134dB return loss) both complete. New project ranking entry added (§15).*

*Previous: v97: Nexus Day 4 session complete. T13 (Notes UI) ✅ and T14 (Project system prompt editor) ✅ both implemented and confirmed working. Markdown rendering added (zero-dep `renderMarkdown()` inline parser). Settings text button replaces broken ⚙ glyph. Backend routes `GET/DELETE /projects/{id}/notes/*` and `PATCH /projects/{id}` live. MVP scope table updated. Build log Day 4 entry added.*

*Previous: v96: Nexus §13 updated — Gemini model corrected to `gemini-2.5-flash` (live-confirmed June 13). Both models verified working. MasterPlan_v2 generated (`Plan/Nexus_MasterPlan_v2.md` — 24 tasks, 4 phases). MVP scope table updated to Phase 3/v0.5/v1.0 terminology. Build log Day 3 entry added.*

*Previous: v94 — Added CV & Portfolio sync trigger to Cross-Document Consistency Check section. CV v8 current (Last Updated: June 12, 2026). Portfolio html last-updated date must be verified on upload.*

*Previous: v93 — Fusemachines Week 7 Clustering Assignment marked Complete. Notebook executed end-to-end (S0–S9), repo `fuseAiF_wk7_customer_segmentation` organized (root: executed notebook, PDF, plots/, README, LICENSE, .gitignore with `*.xlsx` ignored; dev artifacts/debug scripts/task plans moved to `misc/` subfolders). Project ranking updated (8.0, Complete). **PORTFOLIO TRIGGER set**: add Week 7 entry to `aaradhyadtmr.github.io` Projects via Decap CMS, matching Week 6 entry style.*

*Previous: v92 — Nexus architecture pivoted from PostgreSQL + ChromaDB to SQLite + FTS5 (v2 redesign). Full backend rewrite (`main.py` — single file, contextmanager DB, FTS5 context injection, key rotation). Frontend redesigned (dark editorial UI, dynamic model columns, Google index routing sidebar). Stack now: React (Vite) · FastAPI · SQLite + FTS5 · httpx · asyncio. Day 2 complete. All Nexus references in profile updated.*

*Previous: v91 — Week 7 Clustering task plan iterated to v3. Gap analysis vs PDF revealed: category spend ratios (keyword-bucketing on Description — 5-category minimum), IQR + Z-score both required for outlier detection, StandardScaler vs RobustScaler explicit decision required (RobustScaler not in S0 imports — needs justification comment per notebook rule). Notebook `.ipynb` read — additional gaps: PDF says `single` linkage, notebook says `average` as 3rd method; resolved by running all 4 dendrograms but fitting only `Hierarchical_Ward` + `Hierarchical_Alt` (matching notebook scaffold column names for S7 compatibility); `Birch` imported in S0 (available for S10); S7 comparison table is 3-row scaffold + optional extras. Final deliverable: `Week7_Clustering_TaskPlan_v3.md`.*

*Previous: v90 — Fusemachines Week 7 Clustering Assignment logged (due June 21, 2026; UCI Online Retail II dataset; K-Means + Hierarchical + DBSCAN pipeline; full task plan `Week7_Clustering_TaskPlan.md` generated; skills added: clustering algorithms, silhouette/Davies-Bouldin/Calinski-Harabasz validation metrics, RFM feature engineering, DBSCAN parameter tuning). Today's exam: O&M Internal Test 1 (June 12, Jestha 29).*

*Previous: v89 — Nexus project added (AI Workflow Hub — personal AI operating system; repo `nexus` under AaradhyaDT; MIT license; React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + ChromaDB; Day 1 skeleton built; session plan embedded as trigger context).*

*Previous: v88 — PrakopNet BOM updated (RA-02 433 MHz removed → RYLR890 868 MHz adopted; JSN-SR04T replaces HC-SR04; CN3791 replaces TP4056; INA219 added); Nepal LoRa frequency compliance documented (865–867 MHz legal band confirmed); RPi 4B 4GB RAM locked as gateway; feasibility verdict summarised (core demo 80% confidence; 7 additional risk gaps flagged); ChronologicalMerge key doc updated to v3.*

*Previous: v87 — Health diagnosis (chronic allergic conjunctivitis) added; Downloads folder structure documented; C: drive storage analysis noted; HimalGuard_Modifications file removed from key docs (deleted locally); Internal Test 1 context clarified; Ollama model inventory added to System Setup; IDM folder size flagged.*

## 📋 Session Loading Instructions

Upload this single file at the start of any Claude session. It contains:
- Full personal & academic identity
- All projects (with CV-accurate descriptions)
- Professional roles & fellowships
- Skills stack & system setup
- Family background & financial context
- Thinking style & Claude preferences
- Ceiling assessment & trajectory planning

### 🔄 Cross-Document Consistency Check (AUTO-TRIGGER)

**When this master profile is loaded alongside any other document, Claude must automatically:**

1. **Scan all uploaded documents** for references that conflict with or predate the master profile's current state
2. **Flag stale references** before proceeding with any task — do not silently use outdated information
3. **Report conflicts** in a brief table at session start: Document | Stale Reference | Current Value in Master

**Known staleness patterns to check for:**

| Check | Current Master Value |
|---|---|
| Project name | **PrakopNet** (formerly HimalGuard — flag any doc still using HimalGuard) |
| Major project direction | Idea D (PrakopNet) confirmed; Idea C (Counter-UAV) archived |
| Major project deadline | **March 2027** (boards/submission); January 2027 = coursework graduation only |
| 8th semester timeline | **Sep 2026 → Mar 2027** |
| Elective I | **EX 725 04 — Aeronautical Telecommunication** (confirmed) |
| Team project roles | PrakopNet roles (see team split table in Major Project §8) — not Counter-UAV roles |
| Masters plan | **Deferred** — only if fully-funded scholarship; not immediate post-graduation |
| Module C PM2.5 | **Included** (reinstated — viable with 6-month timeline) |
| Portfolio hosting | **GitHub Pages** (current, live, confirmed June 21, 2026 — vanilla JS single-file). Netlify + Decap CMS is a **planned future migration**, not yet executed. GitHub Projects (multi-page) also under consideration as an alternative. |
| Nexus project | Repo `nexus` under `AaradhyaDT`; MIT; React + FastAPI + **SQLite + FTS5**; Day 1 skeleton June 10, 2026; v2 redesign complete June 12, 2026; T13+T14 done June 13, 2026 |

**Documents most likely to be stale:**
- `PROFILE_AaradhyaDevTamrakar_v4` — roles reference Counter-UAV; needs v5
- `PROFILE_RupeshKadel_v5` — roles reference Counter-UAV; needs v6
- `PROFILE_SankalpaLamsal_v3` — roles reference Counter-UAV; needs v4
- `PROFILE_SoniaThapa_v3` — roles reference Counter-UAV; needs v4
- `TEAM_PROFILE_SYSTEM_v11_20260610.md` — **current** (individual profiles deprecated; all 4 member profiles absorbed; PrakopNet roles live)
- `MASTER_MajorProject_ChronologicalMerge_v3_20260610.md` — **current** (Phase 6 added; BOM updated; LoRa compliance resolved)
- ~~`HimalGuard_Modifications_v1_20260608.md`~~ — **DELETED locally** (June 10, 2026). Content absorbed into ChronologicalMerge v2 and master profile. No action needed.

**Rule:** If a stale reference is found, flag it and ask whether to update before proceeding. Never silently use the stale value.

### 📅 CV & Portfolio Last-Updated Sync Check (AUTO-TRIGGER)

**When a CV `.docx` or portfolio `.html` file is uploaded, Claude must automatically:**

1. **Check the CV** — find the `Last Updated:` line (bottom of document). Compare against the date of the current session's edits. If it does not match, flag it: `"CV Last Updated reads [date] — update to [today]?"`
2. **Check the portfolio HTML** — find the last-updated or footer date string in the file. Compare against the date of the current session's edits. If stale, flag it: `"Portfolio HTML last-updated reads [date] — update to [today]?"`
3. **Never silently leave a stale date** — both files must reflect the actual date of the most recent edit before being presented as final.

| Asset | Current Last-Updated | Location in file |
|---|---|---|
| CV (`AARADHYA_DEV_TAMRAKAR_CV_vN.docx`) | **June 12, 2026** | Italicised footer line at document end |
| Portfolio HTML (`index.html` or equivalent) | Verify on upload | Footer or meta section — search `last` or `updated` |

## 👨‍👩‍👦 Family Background

| Member | Age | Role / Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Father** | 53 | Senior Agency Manager, NLIC — client acquisition increasingly difficult[cite: 9] |
| **Mother** | 48 | Part-time health screening associate, IOM[cite: 9] |
| **Brother** | 15 | Just completed SEE; moving to Kathmandu for +2 Science (Computer)[cite: 9] |

- 2 pieces of land in **Damak, Jhapa** — family asset, illiquid[cite: 9]
- **Financial position:** Constrained but stable[cite: 9]. No significant safety net[cite: 9]. Brother arriving adds household pressure[cite: 9].
- **Time horizon:** ~2–3 year window before family expects financial contribution[cite: 9]. Not crisis — but a real clock[cite: 9].

### Generational Context

**Father's side:**
- Wealthy 4+ generations back
- Grandfather was the only son — yet received no inheritance
- Multiple stepmothers entered one after another (fates unconfirmed — left or deceased)
- Stepmother abuse forced grandfather to relocate to Chitwan; inheritance severed entirely despite being the sole male heir
- Root cause: outsider entry → abuse/exclusion → inheritance chain broken

**Mother's side:**
- Wealthy 4+ generations back; poverty hit ~2 generations ago
- Great-grandmother was the 2nd wife — 1st wife had no children; 3rd wife drove the others out, cutting off family support and inheritance
- Root cause: same mechanism — outsider entry → exclusion → inheritance chain broken

**Pattern recognized across both sides:**
- Identical failure mode, independently on both family lines: an external entrant chose exclusion/abuse over family continuity, severing generational wealth at a single inflection point
- Not bad luck — deliberate acts of exclusion repeated across both lineages
- Aaradhya consciously identifies as the generation that breaks this cycle on both lines

- **Loyalty hierarchy:** Immediate family of four → close friends → reciprocal cousins → behavior-based acquaintances[cite: 9]. Extended family who were extractive: no obligation[cite: 9].
- **Marriage approach:** Court marriage first, small celebration, closest only[cite: 9].

### Health

| Condition | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Chronic Allergic Conjunctivitis** | Left eye primarily; diagnosed June 10, 2026. Red eye recurring ~monthly since Falgun (Feb 2026), alternating eyes. Treatment: antihistamine eye drops (use on schedule, not just on flares). Screen-heavy sessions aggravate it. |
| **Eye care note** | Hostel environment (dust/shared spaces) is a common trigger. Avoid rubbing. Pillow hygiene matters. |

## 🌐 Actual Situation & Path (as of June 2026)

*This section is the ground truth. Not a task log — the real picture.*[cite: 9]

### Where things stand

Aaradhya is 21, finishing BEI at KEC (graduation Jan 2027), with ~2–3 years before the family financial clock becomes a crisis[cite: 9]. He has built a stronger portfolio than most BEI students at his level — real shipped work, not just coursework — but his core gap is **finishing things**[cite: 9]. The gap between what he starts and what ships is the main ceiling limiter[cite: 9]. Completion is the only metric that matters right now[cite: 9].

He is mid-Rahu Mahadasha (through Jan 2040) — the period of maximum amplification[cite: 9]. High upside and high volatility[cite: 9]. Every decision this decade compounds[cite: 9].

### The actual path

**Clarified future goals (June 8, 2026 — in order of execution):**

1. **Fuse AI Fellowship completion** — primary focus through mid-2026. Highest CV leverage. Every week's output must be real, understood code.
2. **Graduate as BEI engineer** — Jan 2027 (coursework complete); boards/project submission March 2027. PrakopNet demo in hand.
3. **CNS/aeronautical engineering role** — post-graduation primary income path. CAAN Nepal or AAI India (Junior Executive – Electronics exam). Directly leverages RF & Microwave, signal processing, embedded background. NEC 97/100 mock score = exam-ready.
4. **PrakopNet commercialization** — post-graduation side track alongside job. First pilot: municipality, NGO, or hydropower operator. Makerspace fabrication resources make the hardware demo professional-grade.
5. **Masters** — deferred. Only viable if fully-funded scholarship (MEXT, DAAD, Erasmus Mundus) appears. Unfunded masters during the financial clock window is high-risk and competes directly with PrakopNet momentum. Target Year 3–5 post-graduation, with 2–3 years of domain context making the research output stronger.

**Phase map:**

| Phase | Period | Primary | Secondary | Background |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exam period | Now → Jun 26 | Exams | Fellowship (weekly deadlines hold it) | Makerspace web dev, Excelerate application |
| Fellowship final stretch | Jul → Aug 2026 | Fellowship completion | Excelerate internship (if matched) | PrakopNet architecture, DataCamp |
| 8th semester | Sep 2026 → Mar 2027 | PrakopNet demo | NEC license prep | DataCamp certs, IEEE events |
| Post-graduation | Mar → Aug 2027 | Job applications (CNS + AI/ML) | PrakopNet pilot/grant push | Upwork profile (portfolio now complete) |
| Year 1–3 | 2027–2030 | CNS/engineering job | PrakopNet commercialization | Masters prep (if funded path appears) |

**Time slot rule (completion gap countermeasure):**
One primary. One secondary. Background only for things that run themselves. Nothing enters the primary slot until the current primary ships or has an immovable external deadline. This is the structural fix for the known commitment-stacking pattern. Fellowship deadlines are the proof it works — same forcing function must be replicated for every new commitment.

**Earning timeline:**

| Milestone | Target | Earning |
|---|---|---|
| Excelerate application | This week (apply now, start Jul) | Structured project, possible pay, CV line |
| Fellowship completes | Mid-2026 | GitHub portfolio live and visible |
| PrakopNet demo | Mar 2027 | Grant applications competitive; pilot conversations viable |
| Post-graduation job | Jan–Jun 2027 | Rs. 40–70k/month Nepal / ₹6–12 LPA India |
| PrakopNet pilot | Year 1–2 | NGO grant or municipal contract upside |
| Upwork side income | Year 1 (job stable) | Rs. 15–25k/month supplementary |

**Excelerate + OpportunitiesRadar:**
- Excelerate: virtual project-based internships, 4–8 week commitments. Target: AI/ML pipeline or IoT projects. Apply this week; start July post-exams. "Intern at [Company]" reads better than "Freelancer" for CNS/engineering job applications.
- OpportunitiesRadar: discovery aggregator only. Use weekly to find Nepal-relevant AI/ML, IoT, disaster tech internships and PrakopNet-relevant grant calls.

**Phase 1 — Now to March 2027 (before graduation/boards)**[cite: 9]

The goal is to graduate with a CV that can compete for ML/AI engineering roles at ₹6–12 LPA entry (India is one option under active consideration — not confirmed), and build enough credential mass that any post-graduation move is justified rather than a leap into the dark[cite: 9].

What's currently running:
- **Fusemachines AI Fellowship** (the primary focus): Weeks 1–6 complete; **Week 7 Clustering Assignment in progress (due June 21, 2026)**[cite: 9]. This is the most valuable thing on the CV right now[cite: 9]. Every week's output needs to be real, understood code — not copy-pasted[cite: 9]. Fellowship ends mid-2026[cite: 9].
- **Portfolio website — CMS migration (June 10, 2026)**: `aaradhyadtmr.github.io` migrated from static GitHub Pages to **Decap CMS + Netlify** architecture. Projects, Experience, and Achievements now managed via CMS UI at `/admin/`. `index.html` refactored to async `loadCMSData()` fetching `/content/projects.json`, `/content/experience.json`, `/content/achievements.json`. `netlify.toml`, `admin/config.yml`, and pre-populated JSON files committed to repo.
- **IEEE KEC Vice Chair**: Running real events[cite: 9]. SPAx "Engineer Your Profile" happened May 23[cite: 9]. The risk is it becomes a title without substance — must run something that leaves a mark[cite: 9].
- **Major Project — PrakopNet** (Idea D, confirmed June 8, 2026): Solar-powered LoRa mesh multi-hazard EWS. Demo target: **March 2027 boards**. Makerspace Ambassador access (3D printing, laser cutting, 1Gbps WiFi) directly supports hardware fabrication. See Major Project section for full spec.[cite: 9]
- **DataCamp certs** (NSSR fellowship): Fully completed Phase 1 Applied AI portfolio[cite: 3, 5, 8]. Transitioning to SQL Associate + Python Data Associate pathways[cite: 8]. Data Engineer + Data Scientist + AI post-fellowship[cite: 9]. Background resource — zero conflict with Fusemachines[cite: 9].
- **Algoverse AI Research application**: Deadline May 24[cite: 9]. Research problem: "Efficient Multimodal Reasoning on Edge Devices: Quantization Strategies for Real-Time Gesture Recognition Using Optimized LLMs[cite: 9]." Grounded in live DeepSeek R1 7B on Intel Arc + GCSBR[cite: 9]. If accepted: full-time 8–12 week research block June–Aug 2026[cite: 9]. Targets NeurIPS edge ML workshops / ACL efficiency track[cite: 9].

What's been cancelled or deprioritized:
- **Robotica 6-Month Robotics Technician Program**: Cancelled[cite: 9]. Morning batch conflict, budget, and Algoverse opportunity made it the right cut[cite: 9].
- **eSewa Android Intern**: Applied May 13[cite: 9]. Outcome unknown[cite: 9]. If not selected: no disruption — it was an opportunistic application, not the plan[cite: 9].

**Phase 2 — Post-graduation (March 2027 onward)**[cite: 9]

**Primary career target: CNS/aeronautical engineering.** RF & Microwave, signal processing, embedded systems background maps directly to CNS ground infrastructure (VHF/UHF comms, ILS, DVOR, SSR, ADS-B, MLAT). NEC mock score 97/100 = exam-ready.

- **Nepal:** CAAN (Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal) CNS/electronics roles — stable, government-adjacent, limited openings per year.
- **India:** AAI Junior Executive (Electronics) — written exam path, tens of openings, BEI + NEC qualifies directly. Bangalore / Pune / Hyderabad under consideration.
- **AI/ML engineering roles:** Fusemachines fellowship credential is the pitch. ₹6–12 LPA entry India.

Strategic alignment: CNS job + PrakopNet are synergistic. Day job builds domain relationships with the same infrastructure operators who are PrakopNet's target customers (DHM, CAAN-adjacent, telecom serving remote areas).

**Masters:** Deferred unless fully-funded scholarship. Without funding: wait until Year 3–5. A thesis on edge AI for disaster EWS at that point upgrades PrakopNet's research novelty score (7.5 → 9+) and builds international fundraising network. Better research output with 2–3 years of domain experience behind it.

NI cert sequence (if AI/ML engineering path): CLAD post-fellowship (mid-2026, 6 mo LabVIEW practice) → CTD simultaneously → CLD (Year 2–3) → branch to CLED or CTA depending on first job domain[cite: 9].

### The honest constraints

- **Completion gap**: Starts well, loses momentum[cite: 9]. SysOptimizer v5, Alpha app, portfolio site fixes — all partially done[cite: 9]. The pattern is known[cite: 9]. Fellowship deadlines are the only structure that's been reliably closing things[cite: 9].
- **Financial clock**: Not crisis yet[cite: 9]. But the window is real[cite: 9]. Earning before graduation (Rs. 15–20k/month) changes psychological position significantly[cite: 9].
- **No shortcuts on understanding**: AI/local LLM environment is set up[cite: 9]. The risk is using it as a crutch rather than a tool[cite: 9]. The fellowship work has been done with genuine understanding — that needs to stay true[cite: 9].

### What would constitute success by March 2027

1. Next-gen applied GenAI competencies locked via structured training pipelines[cite: 3, 5].
2. Fusemachines fellowship completed with public GitHub deliverables for every week — visibly real work[cite: 9]
3. Major Project functional demo — runs, not just documented[cite: 9]
4. Alpha on Play Store **or** one DataCamp career cert[cite: 9]
5. Post-graduation plan concrete: offer in hand, or strong pipeline of applications[cite: 9]

### 8. Major Project — PrakopNet *(Idea D — CONFIRMED PRIMARY, June 8, 2026)*

**Full title:** Solar-Powered LoRa Mesh Multi-Hazard Monitoring and Early Warning Platform with GPS Localization and Edge AI for Remote Regions of Nepal

**Team:** Aaradhya Dev Tamrakar · Rupesh Kadel · Sankalpa Lamsal · Sonia Thapa (KEC BEI Batch 2081)

**Status as of June 10, 2026:**
Idea D (PrakopNet) is the confirmed major project direction. Idea C (Counter-UAV) has been archived. **Deadline: March 2027 (8th semester boards)** — 6 months of build time from September 2026. The team will graduate with working hardware, not just documentation.

**Timeline & Budget assessment (June 10, 2026):**
6-month build window (Sep 2026 → Mar 2027). Full-scope viable at core level (80% confidence); full scope including all 🟠–🟢 items is 50% confidence — scope-lock at project kickoff is essential. Order all import components in Month 1 (2–3 week AliExpress/Amazon India lead time). All LoRa modules are now import-only (see LoRa compliance note below).

**LoRa Frequency Compliance (confirmed June 10, 2026):**
Nepal legal band: **865–867 MHz** (IN865-867 channel plan, NTA). Max 1W TX / 4W ERP. The 433 MHz band (EU433) is legal but limited to 10 mW ERP — insufficient for the 3–15 km range claims. US915/AU915 (902–928 MHz) is **illegal** in Nepal (assigned to Ncell/NTC 4G).

**Critical BOM change (June 10, 2026):**
LoRa RA-02 (SX1276, 410–525 MHz / 433 MHz variant) **removed** from BOM — 433 MHz ERP limit invalidates range claims. Replaced with **RYLR890 (868 MHz, UART AT commands)**. Also: HC-SR04 → JSN-SR04T (waterproof); TP4056 → CN3791 (solar-rated charge controller); INA219 current sensor added (power budget measurement, thesis contribution).

**Nepal hardware availability (updated June 10, 2026):**

**Fusemachines fellowship → PrakopNet skill mapping (confirmed June 10, 2026):**
| Fellowship Output | PrakopNet Role |
|---|---|
| LSTM (Wk4 CLV time-series) | Core edge inference: sensor time-series → hazard score |
| SMOTE (Wk5) | Imbalanced disaster event data — same fix |
| SHAP (Wk5) | Explainability for defense: which sensor triggered alert |
| XGBoost/RF (Wk5) | Lightweight fallback classifier on gateway |
| FastAPI + Docker (Wk3) | Base station dashboard + alert API |
| Papermill (Wk4) | Automated retraining pipeline on new seasonal data |
| PC-side pipeline discipline | Training → TFLite quantization → ESP32 deployment chain |

**Team ownership (locked — see team split table above):**
- Firmware/hardware node + LoRa mesh + gateway hardware: **Rupesh** (primary) + **Sankalpa** (hardware assembly, solar, 3D design)
- ML pipeline (training → quantize → TFLite deploy) + HazardScore fusion + LaTeX thesis: **Aaradhya**
- Backend (FastAPI) + grant writing: **Aaradhya** (secondary)
- Dashboard frontend (Streamlit/Flask) + data logging + GPS visualization: **Sonia** (primary)
- Report/documentation co-lead (thesis structure, section drafts): **Sonia** (secondary)

**Architecture:**
- **Sensor Nodes:** ESP32 DevKit V1 + RYLR890 (LoRa 868 MHz, UART AT commands) + GPS (Neo-6M) + Solar subsystem (6V 5W panel → CN3791 charge controller → 18650 ×2 parallel → MT3608 boost → 5V) + INA219 power monitor + environmental sensors
- **Gateway:** Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM) + RYLR890 (UART) + dashboard server + PostgreSQL + AI processing
- **AI Layer:** Federated TFLite Micro on ESP32 nodes (local binary anomaly decision) + LSTM at gateway (multi-sensor time-series → HazardScore) + TFLite runtime at gateway

**Modular Sensor Modules:**
- Module A — Flood: ultrasonic water level sensor
- Module B — Landslide: MPU6050 + optional geophone
- Module C — Air Quality: MQ135 + PM2.5
- Module D — Weather: rain gauge, wind, humidity
- Module E — Wildfire: smoke + temperature
- Module F — Structural Health: strain gauges, vibration sensors

**Build Phases:**
- Phase 1: ESP32 + LoRa + GPS + MPU6050 + DHT22 + solar subsystem → basic network
- Phase 2: Water level + rainfall monitoring
- Phase 3: Geophone + GSM backup + PM2.5

**Assessment:**
| Dimension | Current | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Academic Value | 9/10 | 9.5/10 |
| Commercial Potential | 9/10 | 9.5/10 |
| Buildability | 9/10 | 9/10 (hold) |
| Research Novelty | 7.5/10 | 8.5–9/10 |
| Nepal Relevance | 10/10 | 10/10 (hold) |

**What's locked — do not touch:**
ESP32 + LoRa SX1278 + Neo-6M GPS + Solar + 18650 per node · RPi 4B as gateway · LoRa mesh topology · LSTM + TinyML at AI layer · Module A (Flood) + Module B (Landslide) as core two · MPU6050 for seismic · DHT22 for temperature/humidity

**Phase 5 Technical Modifications (originally from HimalGuard_Modifications_v1, now in MASTER_MajorProject_ChronologicalMerge_v2):**

| Modification | Priority | Build Effort | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Federated TFLite edge inference on ESP32 nodes** — each node runs local binary anomaly model; alerts fire even if LoRa gateway link degraded; direct transfer from GCSBR + Edge AI Stability Detection work | 🔴 1 — Do not drop | 2–3 weeks | Novelty +1 point; disaster resilience |
| **Multi-hazard composite HazardScore (0–100)** — gateway fuses WaterLevel + SeismicAmplitude + RainfallRate + SlopeInstability with tunable weights per zone; threshold bands Green/Amber/Red | 🟠 4 | 1 week | Novelty +0.5; commercial clarity |
| **Solar power telemetry logging** — ADC voltage read on ESP32 → log panel voltage + battery SoC per node per interval; publishable empirical dataset (no Nepal equivalent exists) | 🟠 5 | 2–3 hrs HW + 1 day firmware | New empirical contribution |
| **Adaptive LoRa Spreading Factor** — nodes auto-select SF7–SF12 based on RSSI from last gateway ACK; graceful degradation in disaster conditions | 🟡 6 | 1 week | Disaster robustness |
| **GPS-fenced alert zones** — lat/lon polygon per deployment zone; alert propagates only if anomaly falls within boundary | 🟡 7 | 2–3 hrs (point-in-polygon) | Reduced false positives; commercial pitch strength |

**Scope cuts:**
- Modules E (Wildfire) and F (Structural Health) → document as future work
- Geophone → MPU6050 covers the need; document as upgrade option
- GSM backup → LoRa mesh handles graceful degradation; document as future work
- >3 physical nodes → build 2–3 real; simulate mesh scale in thesis
- Module C (Air Quality): MQ135 + PM2.5 ✅ (viable with 6-month timeline — procure early September)
- Module D (Weather): DHT22 + one rain sensor only

**Research novelty fix strategy (7.5 → 8.5+):**
1. **Literature gap statement (Chapter 1):** "Existing LoRa-based EWS address single-hazard monitoring in isolation. No published system demonstrates multi-hazard fusion with edge-computed composite risk scoring, GPS-tagged anomaly localization, distributed ESP32 TFLite inference, and solar-powered autonomous mesh operation validated in South Asian deployment contexts." Each clause independently verifiable on IEEE Xplore.
2. **Real sensor data for LSTM:** Deploy ≥1 node for 2–4 weeks before thesis submission (Oct–Nov 2026). Even 2 weeks of clean time-series is sufficient for anomaly threshold calibration. Real-data LSTM = a result; synthetic LSTM = background method.
3. **Measured power budget as standalone contribution:** Current draw at deep sleep / sensor active / LoRa TX (measure with multimeter); panel output hourly log; battery endurance calculated + measured → "Node X operates autonomously for Y days on Z mAh at Nepal average irradiance."

**Makerspace deliverables:**
- 3D printing: weatherproof node enclosures (IP54+ minimum) — separate compartments for battery, sensor, electronics; cable glands; solar panel mounting tab; snap-fit lid with gasket channel. Gateway housing (RPi 4B + LoRa hat, vented semi-outdoor).
- Laser cutting: pole/fence mounting bracket for field deployment; internal node chassis to fix sensor positions (reduces MPU6050 mechanical noise); acrylic gateway display panel.
- 1Gbps WiFi: full Docker stack (PostgreSQL + FastAPI + Streamlit) locally; real-time data streaming tests; heavy LSTM training without bandwidth constraint.

**Commercialization pathway:**
Build for academic submission: Basic Tier (live sensor feed, alert status, GPS map markers).
Document as product roadmap (Chapter 6): Professional Tier (LSTM predictions, historical analytics, PDF report export) · Enterprise Tier (GIS polygon overlays, multi-site management, API for municipalities).
One real client conversation before graduation — target one municipality ward office, one local NGO (Red Cross Nepal), or one hydropower project. Even informal letter of interest = grant applications 10× stronger.
PrakopNet landing page: 2–3 hours on portfolio stack; host on GitHub Pages; use as Makerspace Ambassador web dev deliverable.
Grant applications (submit Oct 2026): UNDP Nepal Innovation Challenge · NRCS innovation calls · Social Alpha · Rockefeller ACCRN.

### 14. Fusemachines Week 7 Clustering Assignment *(Completed — June 12, 2026)*
**Stack:** Python · scikit-learn · scipy · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn · NearestNeighbors
**Dataset:** UCI Online Retail II (~500,000 transactions, `Year 2010-2011` sheet)
**Repo:** `AaradhyaDT/fuseAiF_wk7_customer_segmentation`

- **Context:** Market segmentation — build customer profiles from raw transaction data with no labels.
- **Pipeline:** Raw transactions → RFM feature engineering + extended features (AvgBasketSize, AvgDaysBetweenPurchases, UniqueProducts, ReturnRate) + **category spend ratios** (keyword-bucketing on `Description` into ≥5 categories: Gift/Home/Seasonal/Stationery/Other) → preprocessing (IQR + Z-score outlier detection compared; StandardScaler vs RobustScaler explicit decision) → K-Means (Elbow + Silhouette, k-means++ vs random init comparison) → Hierarchical (Ward + Complete + Average + Single dendrograms; fit Ward + Complete) → DBSCAN (k-distance ε estimation, ≥3 param combos, noise analysis) → validation (Silhouette / Davies-Bouldin / Calinski-Harabasz) → business narrative (cluster profiles + executive summary) → failure log (≥3 entries).
- **Status:** Notebook executed end-to-end, all sections S0–S9 complete; submitted as `Week_7_Clustering_Assignment_executed.ipynb`. Repo organized — root contains executed notebook, assignment PDF, plots/, README, LICENSE, .gitignore (raw `.xlsx` dataset gitignored); dev artifacts/debug scripts/task plans archived under `misc/`.
- **Submission:** Single `.ipynb`, all cells executed, handed in via Google Classroom (AI Fellowship 2026) — due June 21, 2026.

> **PORTFOLIO TRIGGER:** Week 7 Clustering Assignment is complete — add a portfolio entry to `aaradhyadtmr.github.io` (Projects, via Decap CMS `/content/projects.json`), matching the style of the Week 6 entry (§11). Suggested summary: "Customer segmentation on UCI Online Retail II — RFM + category-ratio feature engineering, K-Means/Hierarchical/DBSCAN clustering, full statistical validation and business narrative." Link to `AaradhyaDT/fuseAiF_wk7_customer_segmentation`.

### 15. RF and Microwave Engineering Lab Reports *(Active — June 2026)*

### 13. Nexus — Personal AI Operating System *(Active — T13+T14 done June 13, 2026)*
**Stack:** React (Vite) · FastAPI · SQLite + FTS5 · httpx · asyncio
**Repo:** `AaradhyaDT/nexus` · **License:** MIT

> **TRIGGER:** When "Nexus" is mentioned, load this full context before responding.

**Vision:** Not a chatbot. A project-centric AI operating system that unifies Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) and Gemini into one workspace — replacing the multi-browser, multi-account, multi-tool fragmented workflow.

**Core concept:** One prompt → one project context → multiple model outputs (parallel fan-out) → centralized persistent memory.

**Architecture (v2 — confirmed June 12, 2026):**
```
React Frontend (localhost:5173)
        ↓ REST
FastAPI Backend (localhost:8000)
        ↓
   SQLite — nexus.db
   ├── projects  (name, g_index, g_email, system prompt)
   ├── history   (prompt, responses JSON, models_used, timestamp)
   └── FTS5      (project_notes_fts — auto context injection)
        ↓
   Model Router
Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) · Gemini 2.5 Flash
```

**v2 key decisions:**
- **SQLite replaces PostgreSQL** — single `nexus.db` file, no service to run, `contextmanager` pattern
- **FTS5 replaces ChromaDB** — native SQLite full-text search; relevant notes auto-prepended to system prompt on every query; zero embedding latency
- **No OAuth storage** — Google account routing via index-swap (`/u/0`, `/u/1`); project stores `g_index` + `g_email` label only; browser sessions handle auth
- **Single `main.py`** — all routes, adapters, DB, FTS injection in one file (~130 lines)
- **Multi-key rotation** — comma-separated `GROQ_API_KEYS` / `GEMINI_API_KEYS` pools; auto-retry on 429/401/403

**Task plan:** `Plan/Nexus_MasterPlan_v2.md` — 24 tasks across 4 phases (canonical, supersedes all Day 1/Day 2/Complete_TaskPlan docs).

**MVP scope (v0.2 → v0.5 → v1.0):**
| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Project workspaces (create/switch) | ✅ |
| Multi-model parallel fan-out (Groq + Gemini) | ✅ |
| Side-by-side results, dynamic columns | ✅ |
| Persistent history — SQLite | ✅ |
| FTS5 context injection from project notes | ✅ |
| Google account index routing (sidebar links) | ✅ |
| Multi-key rotation | ✅ |
| Dark/light theme toggle | ✅ |
| Clear history (backend DELETE route + UI) | ✅ |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash live confirmed | ✅ |
| Notes UI (save/view/delete from frontend) | ✅ T13 done June 13 |
| Project system prompt editor (Settings modal) | ✅ T14 done June 13 |
| Markdown rendering (zero-dep `renderMarkdown()`) | ✅ T13/T14 session |
| start-nexus.bat cold launch verified | ⬜ Phase 3 |
| History deletion DB-level verified | ⬜ Phase 3 |
| Cost/token tracker | ⬜ v0.5 T15 |
| History search + Markdown export | ⬜ v0.5 T16/T17 |
| Ollama local model support | ⬜ v1.0 |
| Task-aware routing | ⬜ v1.0 |
| Agent mode | ⬜ v1.0 |

**Build log:**
- **Day 1 (June 10, 2026):** Backend skeleton — Groq + Gemini fan-out via `asyncio.gather`, multi-key rotation, CORS. Frontend — Vite React, textarea, side-by-side results. End-to-end confirmed ✅
- **Day 2 (June 11–12, 2026):** Architecture pivoted from PostgreSQL+ChromaDB to SQLite+FTS5 (v2). Full backend rewrite. Full frontend redesign — dark editorial UI, project sidebar, Google account routing, history panel. v2 complete ✅. UI verified rendering correctly (design/sidebar/forms ✅; model pills require backend running). Folder structure corrected (backend/, frontend/src/ — was flat) ✅
- **Day 3 (June 13, 2026):** Gemini 2.5 Flash live-confirmed ✅. Both models (Groq + Gemini) verified responding in parallel. `MasterPlan_v2.md` generated — 24 tasks, 4 phases, supersedes all prior plan docs. Pending: start-nexus.bat cold launch, history deletion DB-level check, theme persistence verify.
- **Day 4 (June 13, 2026, afternoon):** T13 Notes UI ✅ + T14 Project system prompt editor ✅ — both implemented and confirmed working (screenshot 2:10 PM). Backend additions: `GET /projects/{id}/notes`, `DELETE /projects/{id}/notes/{note_id}`, `PATCH /projects/{id}` (supports name/prompt/g_index/g_email partial update). Frontend: collapsible notes panel (textarea + Save note + per-note × delete + note count badge + "Note saved" toast); Settings text button (replaces ⚙ glyph — cross-platform rendering fix); settings modal (system prompt textarea, g_email, g_index, PATCH on save, "Saved" toast, backdrop dismiss). Markdown rendering added: zero-dep `renderMarkdown()` (~80 lines) handles **bold**, *italic*, `` `code` ``, fenced code blocks with lang label, h1/h2/h3, ul/ol, `---` hr, blank lines → `<br>`, paragraphs; output columns now use `nx-md-body` div (wrapping prose) instead of `<pre>`. Both Groq and Gemini responses render formatted markdown ✅.

**Key risks:**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| API cost blowup from fan-out | Token tracker per project (v0.5 T15) |
| Context window overflow in long sessions | Summarization layer — don't raw-append history |
| Completion gap | Treat each session like a Fellowship deadline |

**Portfolio angle:**
- Benchmark: show parallel routing improves output quality vs. single-model baseline
- Technical writeup: "Multi-model orchestration with FTS5 context injection"
- MCP integration (v1.0) signals agentic tool standard awareness

**Strategic note:** Nexus is also PrakopNet's development infrastructure. The project notes + FTS5 layer = same architecture needed for sensor logs, LSTM experiment records, and literature references.

## 🔧 Fellowship Dev Standards — 12-Factor Pre-Commit Checklist (§16)

> **Rule:** Run this checklist at least once before every final `git commit` on any Fusemachines fellowship repo or Nexus. Not optional. Not "if I remember." Before the commit.

The [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net) methodology defines production-grade software. For fellowship repos, this maps to: code that a reviewer can run cold, reproduces results exactly, and doesn't fail because of a missing env var or hardcoded path.

### The 12 Factors — Pre-Commit Verification

| # | Factor | What to check before commit |
|---|--------|----------------------------|
| **1** | **Codebase** | One repo per project. No untracked experiment branches floating locally. `git status` clean except intentional staged files. |
| **2** | **Dependencies** | `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` updated and pinned. No implicit `pip install X` in README that isn't in the lockfile. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in a clean venv to verify. |
| **3** | **Config** | Zero hardcoded secrets, API keys, DB passwords, or absolute paths in code. All config via `.env` (not committed). `.env.example` committed with placeholder values. `.env` in `.gitignore`. |
| **4** | **Backing services** | DB connection strings, external APIs, storage paths all read from env vars — not hardcoded. Swapping Postgres → SQLite should require only a `.env` change. |
| **5** | **Build / Release / Run** | Dockerfile (if present) separates install from runtime. No `pip install` in the `CMD`/entrypoint. Build artifacts not committed (`.gitignore` covers `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `dist/`, `.venv/`). |
| **6** | **Processes** | App is stateless between requests. Session state goes in DB / cache, not in-memory global variables. Verify no module-level mutable state that breaks if two workers run. |
| **7** | **Port binding** | App binds to a port from env var (`PORT` / `BACKEND_PORT`). No hardcoded `8000` or `3000` in code — only in `.env.example`. |
| **8** | **Concurrency** | If using `asyncio.gather` (Nexus fan-out) or Papermill parallel runs — confirm no shared mutable state between concurrent tasks. Worker count set via config, not hardcoded. |
| **9** | **Disposability** | App starts fast (< 5s cold). Graceful shutdown handles SIGTERM (FastAPI lifespan / `finally` blocks). No orphaned DB connections on crash. |
| **10** | **Dev/prod parity** | `docker-compose.yml` (if present) mirrors prod stack exactly. Python version in `runtime.txt` / Dockerfile matches local. No "works on my machine" hacks committed. |
| **11** | **Logs** | No `print()` debug statements left in committed code. Use `logging` module with level controlled by env var (`LOG_LEVEL=INFO`). Logs go to stdout (captured by Docker / systemd). No log files committed. |
| **12** | **Admin processes** | DB migrations, seed scripts, one-off data fixes — all in standalone scripts under `scripts/` or `migrations/`. Never baked into app startup. Run once, document in README. |

### Quick Pre-Commit Command Sequence (Fellowship Standard)

```bash
# 1. Check nothing secret is staged
git diff --cached | grep -iE "(api_key|password|secret|token)" && echo "⚠ SECRET DETECTED" || echo "✅ No secrets"

# 2. Verify .env is NOT staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep "\.env$" && echo "⚠ .env STAGED — remove it" || echo "✅ .env clean"

# 3. Check requirements are updated (Python projects)
pip freeze > /tmp/current_reqs.txt && diff requirements.txt /tmp/current_reqs.txt | head -20

# 4. Run any tests before committing
pytest -q 2>/dev/null || echo "(no tests yet — add at least one smoke test)"

# 5. Final status check
git status && git diff --stat --cached
```

### Per-Repo Compliance Status

| Repo | Factor 2 | Factor 3 | Factor 11 | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `fuseAiF_wk3_text2sql` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Docker + .env pattern established |
| `fuseAiF_wk5_telco_churn_ensembles` | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | No secrets; notebook-based |
| `fuseAiF_wk7_customer_segmentation` | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | `.xlsx` gitignored ✅ |
| `nexus` | ✅ | ⏳ Check .env.example | ⏳ Replace print() with logging | v2 SQLite+FTS5 — verify before next commit |
| Future fellowship repos | — | — | — | Start from this checklist |

## 🌐 Portfolio Website — aaradhyadtmr.github.io

> **STATUS CORRECTION (v103, June 21, 2026):** The Netlify + Decap CMS migration described below was a **plan that was never executed**. Live, confirmed-current state as of this date: **GitHub Pages**, single-file `index.html`, vanilla JS, `DATA` object inline (no `/content/*.json`, no CMS, no Netlify). The animation/architecture notes below remain accurate for the codebase itself — only the hosting/CMS claims are stale. User is now also considering **GitHub Projects** for a multi-page site as an alternative direction. Treat any "Netlify" / "Decap CMS" / "`/admin/`" reference below as **not live**.

- Single-file `index.html` — DATA-driven architecture for static sections (Hero, Skills, About, Contact)[cite: 9]
- **Projects, Experience, Achievements** now served from `/content/*.json` — edited via Decap CMS UI, no code changes needed
- **Hosting:** Netlify (migrated from GitHub Pages, June 10, 2026) — deploy on every CMS commit (~30s)
- **CMS URL:** `yoursite.netlify.app/admin/` — Netlify Identity auth (invite-only)
- **Repo additions:** `admin/config.yml` (schema), `admin/index.html` (CMS entry), `content/projects.json` (10 entries), `content/experience.json` (7 entries), `content/achievements.json` (8 entries), `netlify.toml`
- Dark luxury editorial aesthetic: Cormorant Garamond + DM Mono + Instrument Sans[cite: 9]
- Lighthouse (Desktop): Performance 98, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100[cite: 9]
- GA4 live: Measurement ID G-P38642CDGB[cite: 9]

### Animation System (as of May 30, 2026)

**Background canvas:** `SignalWaveBackground` — 5 slow sine wave signal traces spanning full viewport, gold/teal accent colours, each with a travelling glowing node. Replaces previous `IsometricHexBackground` (hex grid with mouse proximity shimmer).

**Particle layer:** `SparkSystem` (floating embers + click burst) — **removed**. `#particle-canvas` hidden.

**Dividers:** Revolving arc style (CW accent sweep + CCW accent2 counter-sweep). Left half of each divider static; only right half animates. CW: 5s, CCW: 7s, staggered via negative delays. Center node: static glow, no pulse. **[v66] Beams now use `transform: translateX()` on %-width pseudo-elements with `overflow: hidden` on parent — fully GPU-composited, replaces non-composited `clip-path: inset()` animations.**

**CSS ambient animations removed:** section-num flicker, title-shimmer gradient, skill-dot breathe glow, exp-item data-stream, stat-num glow pulse, nav-logo morse-blink.

**Contact icons:** Hover-triggered orbital ring (same revolve-cw / revolve-ccw keyframes as photo ring) around platform icon SVG.

**Photo ring:** Unchanged — revolving arc on hover, CW + CCW.

**Light-theme border parity (added May 30):** All animated border elements pinned to dark-mode accent values (`#d4a85a` / `#6dbfaa`) via an explicit `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` override block. Covers: status card conic-gradient, project card top-edge sweep, app card bottom-edge sweep, divider CW/CCW arcs + node glow, about photo ring arcs + shadow, contact icon orbit rings, contact link left-edge bar, scroll progress gradient, status dot pulse/ripple. Static UI elements (text, tags, skill dots, nav links) continue using light-mode `--accent`/`--accent2` for readability.

**Hash anchor scroll (rebuilt + refined May 30):** Replaced broken `getBoundingClientRect` + `pushState` interceptor. New implementation: delegated `click` listener on `document` → `getElementById(id)` → section `getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset + sectionPaddingTop - nav.offsetHeight - 48` → `window.scrollTo({behavior:'smooth'})` + `history.replaceState`. Initial-load hash handling via `setTimeout(goTo, 120)`. CSS `scroll-margin-top` removed — pure JS, single source of truth.

**Scroll offset transform-independence fix (May 30):** First-click to any section landed 32px too low because `.reveal` children have `translateY(32px)` pending before IntersectionObserver fires. Fix: `goTo()` reads position from the `<section>` root element (never has `.reveal`) + `getComputedStyle(section).paddingTop` to find content start. No child elements queried → fully transform-independent on first and subsequent clicks.

**Contact section scroll fix (May 30):** `querySelector('.section-header')` returned null for `#contact` (which injects `.section-num` directly into `#contact-intro`, no `.section-header` wrapper). Resolved by switching to section root + paddingTop approach — consistent across all 7 sections.

**Photo lazy-load layout shift fix (May 30):** `loading="lazy"` on about photo meant clicking Connect before scrolling past About caused goTo() to calculate Contact's position against a shorter layout (photo not yet loaded). On scroll completion the photo loaded, expanding About and pushing Contact down. Fix: `loading="eager"` (fetch on page load) + `aspect-ratio: 3/4` on `.about-photo` to reserve layout height even before bytes arrive. `object-fit` changed to `cover`.

**Scroll % progress indicator (May 30):** Translucent readout `47%` sits 2.9rem below the back-to-top button. Shows/hides at same >400px scroll threshold with slide-up transition. DM Mono, 0.56rem, `opacity: 0.7`, no background. Mobile: shifts right (`right: 1.5rem`) matching button offset. `aria-hidden="true"` — decorative only.

**Performance compositor fixes (May 30, v66):**
- **GA4 deferred:** `<script async src="gtag/js">` removed from `<head>`; GA4 loaded via `createElement('script')` inside `window.addEventListener('load')` → eliminates ~80ms main-thread parse block on FCP.
- **photo.png preloaded:** `<link rel="preload" as="image" href="photo.png">` before fonts → LCP asset fetched in parallel; targets ~0.8–1.2s LCP reduction.
- **Scroll progress bar composited:** `width: 0% → 100%` + `transform: scaleX(0)` from `transform-origin: left`; JS uses `style.transform = 'scaleX(N)'`; `will-change: transform`; `@keyframes gradient-flow` + `background-position` animation removed.
- **Divider beams composited:** All `clip-path: inset()` keyframes replaced with `transform: translateX()` on %-width pseudo-elements (15% CW, 10% CCW); `overflow: hidden` on `.divider` parent; 14 animation instances now GPU-compositor path.
- **Status card border composited:** `@property --border-angle` + `@keyframes { --border-angle: 0→360deg }` (CSS custom property animation, main thread) replaced with static `conic-gradient(from 0deg, ...)` + `@keyframes border-revolve { transform: rotate(0→360deg) }`. `will-change: transform` added. Light-theme override updated to `from 0deg` too. Visual output identical. All 6 Lighthouse compositor fixes now complete.
- **Double counter-rotating border rings (May 30, v67→v68):** Status card border upgraded to two independent orbital dot rings. All `rotate()` approaches permanently removed. Implementation: JS IIFE measures card (`offsetWidth/Height`) after double rAF, builds CW and CCW rounded-rect `offset-path: path(...)` strings matching card dimensions, injects 8+4 `<span class="sc-dot">` elements as card children. Each dot has `offset-distance` animated via CSS keyframes (`sc-orbit-cw` / `sc-orbit-ccw`) + a `sc-breathe` pulse at 2.4s (matching status-dot rhythm). Staggering: orbit via negative `animation-delay = -(i/n) × duration`; breathe via positive delay `= i × (2.4/n)`. Color: GG-O pattern (2 green : 1 gold) — outer 8: GGOGGOGGG (6G 2O), inner 4: GGOG (3G 1O). Outer ring (inset 3px, CW 9.6s = 4×2.4); inner ring (inset 11px, CCW 14.4s = 6×2.4). Resize: debounced (200ms) removes and respawns all dots. `offset-rotate: 0deg` keeps dots upright on path.

## 🌐 KEC Makerspace Website — `KEC-innovation/makerspace-main`

Organizational site for KEC Maker's Space (separate repo/codebase from the personal `aaradhydtmr.github.io` portfolio above). This is the live Makerspace Ambassador web-dev deliverable[cite: 9]. Static HTML site: `*.html` pages, centralized `assets/css/style.css` + `assets/js/script.js`, Python maintenance scripts in `scripts/`, SOP docs in `docs/`, task tracking in `tasks/task.md`.

### Workflow established (June 17, 2026)
Claude acts as orchestrator: audits the actual repo (uploaded as a zip each round), grounds every finding in real file/line evidence, and writes scoped copy-paste prompts. Aaradhya runs those prompts in VS Code Copilot Chat using **Raptor mini (Preview)** — GitHub Copilot's experimental fast model, Pro/Pro+/Free tiers — in Agent mode for multi-file work and Edit mode for single-line fixes. Each round's findings + prompts are saved as `tasks/raptor-mini-brief*.md` inside the repo itself for continuity.

### Round 1 — site-wide bug fixes (shipped)
- Malformed `<img>` attributes (`class="x" / loading="lazy" decoding="async"/>`) across 48 instances / 17 files — root cause: a regex bug in `scripts/optimize_site.py` + `scripts/fix_site_optimization.py` that inserted lazy-load attributes after a stray trailing slash. Fixed in both scripts; a new one-off `scripts/repair_img_tags.py` cleaned the existing files.
- Opening hours unified across `contact.html`, the shared footer (`assets/js/script.js`), and the search-index entry (previously 3 different values).
- `offerings.html` 3D Scanner card: alt text corrected (was wrongly copy-pasted as "Electronics Workstation"), status badge changed from bare `.tag` to `.tag.tag-free`.
- SOP buttons on Anycubic Kobra 3 / Kobra Neo 2 / xTool Laser Cutter P3 wired to `docs/*-sop.md` — **content is currently a placeholder stub** ("Update this document with the final internal SOP details when available"), not final.
- 2× Bambu Lab A1 printers added to `equip-3dprinter.html` as one combined card (both units are identical machines) — spec'd with build volume 256×256×256mm, AMS Lite, Advanced difficulty, placeholder photo (`3D_print_station.webp` stock image).
- Hero image on `index.html` swapped from AI-generated collage to a real interior photo (`kec_meeting_space.webp`).

### Round 2 — follow-up audit findings (open)
- SOP docs (`docs/anycubic-kobra-3-sop.md`, `-neo-2-sop.md`, `xtool-laser-cutter-p3-sop.md`) are 14-line stubs — need real procedure content.
- Bambu Lab A1 card's "SOP" button mislinks to `get-started.html` instead of a stub/real SOP doc.
- `.tag-required` / `.tag-free` / `.tag-soon` are defined twice with conflicting colors: once in `assets/css/style.css` (gold `.tag-required`), once inline in `offerings.html` (red `.tag-required`) — needs consolidating into one canonical source.
- "Solder, Print & Play" event (dated Apr 26) is stale relative to June 17, 2026 — still listed under "Upcoming Events" instead of "Past Events."
- New task.md Priority 1 items (reusable event template structure, this-Thursday's-workshop entry, past-event migration) not started — **blocked on Aaradhya supplying the actual workshop title/time/capacity/description.**

### Round 3 — font audit (root-caused, prompts written)
Site-wide faux-bold on every `h1`–`h4` plus 7 specific elements: Changa One and Gravitas One are loaded from Google Fonts at weight 400 only (no real bold cut exists for either family), but the global heading rule never resets `font-weight` (browsers default headings to bold) and several rules (`.stat-num`, `.event-date-day`, `.page-header h1`, `.team-avatar`, `.team-name`, `.pillar-num`, `.project-hook`) explicitly force 700/800 on top — the browser synthesizes ("fakes") the bold, distorting glyphs especially at small card-heading sizes. `Syne` is unaffected (loaded with real 600/700/800, used correctly). `Rammetto One` is loaded via the Google Fonts `<link>` on all 17 HTML pages but referenced nowhere in the codebase — pure dead weight, plus an orphaned `.rammetto-one-regular` CSS class that even mistakenly points to "Changa One." Bonus finding: `--text-faint` fails WCAG AA contrast in both themes (dark 2.99:1, light 2.4:1 — needs 4.5:1 for normal-size text), used in 50+ places site-wide.

### Round 4 — navbar animation/hover (proposed)
Sliding underline replacing flat hover/active bg, hamburger→X morph (JS currently never toggles a class on the hamburger button itself), smooth max-height/opacity slide for the mobile nav dropdown (currently an instant `display` toggle), theme-toggle sun/moon icon cross-fade (currently an instant `innerHTML` swap), sticky-navbar scroll-elevation shadow using the existing `--shadow-sm` token, and a logo hover micro-lift reusing the `scale(1.08)` value already established on `.theme-toggle:hover`. All wrapped in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` — `style.css` has a section explicitly titled "ANIMATIONS (removed)" documenting a prior decision to strip motion from the personal portfolio's sibling codebase, so new nav motion respects that precedent rather than reversing it unprompted. Found in the process: desktop `.nav-links a.active` uses `var(--accent)` while `.mobile-nav a.active` uses `var(--accent2)` — same "current page" state, two different colors.

- **OS:** Windows 11 + Ubuntu 26.04 LTS "Resolute Raccoon" dual-boot, Secure Boot ON, Fast Startup OFF[cite: 9]
- **Optimal iGPU VRAM alloc:** 4 GB[cite: 9]

### Fan / Thermal Issue — Diagnosed & Resolved (June 17, 2026)
- **Symptom:** Fans never audibly ran under Ubuntu, even with BIOS Power Mode set to Performance.
- **Root cause:** GNOME quick-settings **Power Mode was set to "Power Saver"** (`power-profiles-daemon` layer, separate from both BIOS power mode and the cpufreq governor). This capped real CPU load enough that the EC's autonomous fan curve threshold was never crossed during normal/light use.
- **Confirmed working (not the problem):** `acpi-fan` driver (5x `PNP0C0B` cooling devices, binary on/off, ACPI4.0), `acer_wmi`, intel_pstate (`active` mode, HWP-reactive — only `performance`/`powersave` governors exist; `schedutil`/`ondemand` not available under intel_pstate active, this is normal).
- **Verification:** `stress-ng --cpu 0` sustained load → Package temp climbed to 95–112°C → fans ramped audibly. Confirmed again at Power Mode = non-Power-Saver with cpufreq `powersave`: fans ramped at 102°C. `dmesg | grep -iE "throttl|critical|emergency"` clean — no silent throttle/shutdown events despite briefly exceeding the `crit=110°C` coretemp label (Tjmax headroom above that label is normal for Meteor Lake).
- **Fix applied:** Power Mode → **Balanced** for daily use (not Power Saver, not Performance — Performance pins EPP high and drains battery unnecessarily for routine work). cpufreq governor left on `powersave` (intel_pstate active mode handles this reactively).
- **Diagnostic commands kept for reference:**
  ```
  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver        # intel_pstate
  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/status                # active
  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors  # performance powersave
  powerprofilesctl set balanced
  for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do cat /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device$i/cur_state; done  # fan cooling devices
  stress-ng --cpu 0 --timeout 90 --metrics-brief
  ```

### Dual-Boot, Partition Layout & BitLocker (set up June 2026)
- **Drive:** 1× 1TB NVMe SSD, 953.85 GB usable. Layout: Windows C: 701.82GB NTFS · D: 150GB NTFS (BitLocker-encrypted, shared data pool) · Ubuntu root 92.20GB ext4 · swap 7.8GB · ~2GB EFI/recovery.
- **Both Windows volumes are BitLocker-encrypted** (Secure Boot + TPM-bound Device Encryption, auto-enabled on Microsoft Account link) — this is why Ubuntu can't auto-mount D: without a manual unlock step.
- **Partition identifiers:** `/dev/nvme0n1p3` = D: (150GB, FDV — Fixed Data Volume); `/dev/nvme0n1p4` = a second BitLocker volume (encountered first by mistake — wrong target).
- **Unlock from Ubuntu (when needed):** `sudo cryptsetup bitlkOpen /dev/nvme0n1p3 windows_data` → paste the 48-digit recovery key (dashes stripped, raw digit string) when prompted → `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/windows && sudo mount /dev/mapper/windows_data /mnt/windows`. GUI/GNOME BitLocker paste prompts are unreliable (clipboard mangling) — terminal `cryptsetup` is the reliable path.
- **Recovery keys:** stored on Microsoft Account recovery-keys page and backed up to SD card (plaintext file, dashes included — strip dashes before using with `cryptsetup`). Multiple key entries exist across past hostnames (`DESKTOP-A1D97GH`, `AARADHYA-SFG16`) — match by **Key ID**, not by guessing; the correct working key for the AARADHYA-SFG16 FDV volume is the one ending `...58B680EA` per the Microsoft account key list. *(Full 48-digit key intentionally not stored in this doc — pull from Microsoft account / SD card backup when needed.)*
- **Permanent fix considered but not yet applied:** disabling Windows Device Encryption entirely would let Ubuntu auto-mount D: without manual unlock each boot — trade-off is losing Windows-side encryption. Currently still encrypted; manual `cryptsetup` unlock is the working flow.
- **Time sync (dual-boot clock drift):** fixed via `timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock` in Ubuntu, then one Windows boot to let it re-sync — keeps both OSes on local time instead of drifting by the UTC/local-time mismatch.
- **Intel Arc iGPU on Ubuntu:** working natively out of the box (Mesa, in-kernel — `glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"` → `Mesa Intel(R) Arc(tm) Graphics (MTL)`, confirming hardware accel, not llvmpipe fallback). Hardware video decode confirmed via `vainfo` (VA-API 1.23, iHD driver, H.264/HEVC/AV1 profiles all present). Required packages: `intel-opencl-icd intel-media-va-driver` (note: package is `intel-media-va-driver`, not `intel-media-driver`, on Ubuntu 26.04 — needs `universe`/`multiverse` repos enabled first via `sudo add-apt-repository universe multiverse`).
- **150GB D: drive automount:** standard GNOME Disks "mount at startup" approach doesn't work directly because of BitLocker — would need a keyfile-based auto-unlock script (`/etc/crypttab` + keyfile) to be fully automatic; not yet implemented, manual `cryptsetup` unlock is current workflow.

## 📊 Profile Self-Assessment

**Overall Rating: 8.8 / 10**

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Technical & Academic | 9.6/10 | Breadth expanded via parallel algorithmic data pipelines and programmatic GenAI modeling tracks[cite: 3, 5, 8]. |
| Astrological Chart | 7.5/10 | Favourable Lagna, complex 12th house stellium, Rahu 7th — high ceiling, high volatility[cite: 9] |

**Ceiling:** High[cite: 9]. Limited by *finishing things* and the financial clock — not intelligence or access[cite: 9].

---

## 🚀 Trajectory

**The realistic strong outcome:** Fusemachines → CNS/AI engineering role → PrakopNet first pilot → Rs. 1.5–3L/month range within 5–7 years post-graduation[cite: 9].

**The high ceiling outcome:** PrakopNet lands a DHM or NGO contract within 2 years of graduation. One shipped product changes the entire trajectory[cite: 9].

**Optimal play:** CNS/engineering job (income floor) + PrakopNet side-tracked commercialization (upside) → funded or experienced-backed Masters (Year 3–5, not immediately)[cite: 9].

### What matters in the next 18 months (in order)
1. **Finish something that ships** — PrakopNet functional demo by March 2027 boards[cite: 9]
2. **Make Fusemachines count** — visible, contributing, known by leadership; every week's code understood[cite: 9]
3. **Don't let IEEE become a title** — run something real at SPAx and beyond[cite: 9]
4. **Start earning before graduation** — Excelerate internship (July 2026 target); Rs. 15–20k/month changes psychological position[cite: 9]
